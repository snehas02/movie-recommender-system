# Movie-recommender-system
My project is Algorithms for recommendation engine.
A content based movie recommender system using cosine similarity.
# What are recommender systems?
It is a subclass of information filtering system that seeks to predict the "rating" or "preference" a user would give to an item.
# Types of recommender systems:
    1.Content based filtering
    2.Collaborative filtering
    3.Hybrid
# The algorithm which I have used to deploy the recommendation engine is Content-based filtering
Content-based filtering methods are based on a description of the item and a profile of the user's preferences.These methods are best suited to situations where there is known data on an item (name, location, description, etc.), but not on the user. Content-based recommenders treat recommendation as a user-specific classification problem and learn a classifier for the user's likes and dislikes based on an item's features.
